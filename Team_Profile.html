      <p class="">Our team name is the DAT Team.
        This name is an acronym from our project idea – Drive Aware Tech Team.
        During Assignment 2, we wanted to come up with a team name that would also sound professional for prospective
        employers. Our team actually came up with a list of proposals and we ran a couple of polls to agree on the final
        name : The DAT Team.

      <img src="A2/assets/Chris-Mugshot.jpg" alt="Christopher's photo" width="300" height="250">

      <p>I currently work in Communications, building the multi-technology mess that is the
        National Broadband Network.
        I completed Year 12 in 2001 and studied Audio Engineering at SAE College in 2004. My audio engineering knowledge
        transferred well to learning how
        optic fibre networks operate. My hobbies include creating digital art, making music on my computer and playing
        video games. I try to maintain some
        level of fitness by making irregular visits to the gym. My interest in IT began through using gaming consoles,
        like the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES)
        and computers in my youth. I fondly recall playing Kid Icarus on my NES and adventure games such as Space Quest
        & Police Quest on an old PC. Although I still
        enjoying gaming, my interests now are more focused on using computers to build websites and for creative
        purposes such as art and music. My experience with IT
        is quite varied. In high school I learned touch typing which greatly increased my efficiency when performing
        tasks on computers. In my late teens I learned to
        build PCs, optimising the builds for the purpose of creating music. Recently, the company I work for launched
        another business focusing on digital signage and
        security systems. This involves integration of surveillance equipment and digital signage into existing networks
        and troubleshooting any issues that arise in the
        process. In a previous role, I used MS Excel for forecasting workloads and staffing requirements based off those
        forecasts. Learning and applying Excel formulas
        sparked my interest in coding and in turn web development. In 2015 I worked at a tech start-up where I was
        responsible for user acceptance testing, creating technical
        documentation, user guides, and video tutorials on how to use the product.

      <p>
        Originally from Sydney, I’ve been lucky to benefit from quite a varied
        upbringing, being schooled in several countries before living in Scotland for most of my adult life. I studied
        pharmacy after leaving school, graduating in 2005 before completing registration training, and passing the
        examination for registration. After this I decided to work freelance as a locum in order to gain as much
        varied experience of the sector as I could. I was responsible for finding work, building a good reputation as
        well as managing my own schedule and accounts. I really enjoyed the nature of this role, needing to adjust to
        new work environments and team members quickly in order to do my job while maintaining accountability and
        responsibility for my own work. Because I enjoyed it so much, after telling myself that I would do it for a
        year or so, I ended up continuing the role one and off for over ten years. During this time I met my wife and
        we went on to have two children.
      </p>

      <p>
        A few years after qualifying, personal events meant a change of scene and some spare time so I decided to
        study laws of international business, an area that interested me and that I thought a knowledge of would prove
        useful in future. I thoroughly enjoyed this, especially competition and EU law, writing my master’s thesis on
        EU competition law, parallel trade and its impact on the pharmaceutical industry. I had not intended that the
        degree would lead to any specific career change and although it has lead to some career opportunities. I see
        its real value in having improved my evaluation of problems and resultant decision making meaning that what
        once would may have seemed overwhelming now appears achievable. I had considered myself to be a critical
        thinker as I had completed a scientific degree but had now learnt another way to assess situations, identify
        relevant issues and solve problems.
      </p>

      <p>
        Recently we accepted opportunity for our family to move back to Australia. Registering as a pharmacist in
        Australia having UK qualifications is surprisingly difficult and there isn’t perhaps the demand for my skills
        as there was in Scotland. Rather than spend time and money on this, I saw it as an opportunity give my career
        a steer in another direction. I have been involved in a few projects related to IT which I had found very
        engaging and had always wondered about being able to improve on the systems with which I have worked. Having
        studied online before, I was confident I would have the self discipline to repeat this and knew that although
        it presents challenges, I value both its flexibility and portability.

        I am a mother to three daughters and married to a System Engineer, who has his
        own business. He concentrates on managing client’s servers
        and I.T networks for their business’s, also he does contract work for the state government and ambulance
        Victoria. My goal is to achieve enough knowledge to feel confident
        enough to be able to assist my husband to allow him to grow his business further. I have been a hairdresser
        for 14 years and have come from a family of hairdressers, so it came
        very naturally to me. As I mature, I regret not furthering my studies from my VCE but have decided it is not
        too late.

        Everything technology related interests me from biomedical engineering to autonomous cars to even cloud-based
        storage, especially for precious photos we accumulate.
        I feel technology is everywhere from our navigation in our cars to our virtual assistants, google home. Using
        YouTube and Netflix has become even easier now being
        accessible via our remote controls and viewed on our smart TV’s.<a

        We are quite tech savvy in our family, also having a husband in I.T has given me some knowledge about cloud
        computing, servers and managing business’s IT needs. I enjoy
        using social media to communicate with friends and family and using cloud-based apps such as Google photos to
        store photos and videos.<a href=" https://www.businessinsider.com/how-does-google-photos-work?r=AU&IR=T"> pg1,

        them more appealing with altering the light, contrast, and shadows. I know how to do all basic functions of
        scanning, emails, using both windows and apple Mac PC’s and
        laptops. I am always eager to learn something new and this course has shown me that I only know a small
        percentage of what I.T is. Since starting Introduction to

        In my spare time, (which does not occur these days) I love painting portraits or landscapes on canvas. I love
        learning new things and growing my knowledge. I love going
        to the beach, spending quality time with family and friends and having a laugh. I love having bonfires and
        roasting marshmallows with my kids. As much as I love technology
        I like to disconnect sometimes and recharge.

        I am a trade qualified baker of 15 years, specialising in sourdough bread. I
        prefer to make sourdough
        bread as it is very hands on and typically does not rely on machines such as dough moulders. I originally
        wanted to be a chef but found I was more suited to baking as a hot kitchen can be quite a stressful
        atmosphere.
        I love cooking at home and making homemade pizzas as it combines my two loves: cooking and making bread.

        IT is an ever-evolving industry and what it is now is completely different to what
        it was 10 years ago. Our lives are affected by IT every day, whether it be our smart phones sending a
        notification
        to us sitting down in front of the TV watching Netflix. It’s this kind of innovation that interests me and
        what will come.
        I was initially interested in IT as a high school student while taking computing classes. However, as my life
        evolved and started
        new activities, my interest took a back seat to everyday life goals and needs.
      </p>

      <p>
        My interest in IT has been re-sparked as I look to future proof my career and get out of the hospitality
        industry. I have no professional experience in IT outside of being an end user.

      <h2 id="groupProcesses">Group Processes</h2>

      <p>Our group worked well together in Assignment 2 considering we had just met each
        other, therefore we did not make too many changes for Assignment 3.
        The meeting times and days as well as the agendas, recordings & notes were carried over from Assignment
        2.
      </p>
      <p>
        One area that we thought could use improvement was keeping up with each other’s progress.
        We thought if we had just one shared document as our content version then it would be easier for us all to know
        where each other was at and chip in if needed. In Assignment 2, there was some confusion near the end with some
        improvement text not being included due to not having the latest version.
        </p>

      <p>For Assignment 3, we thought we would try working off one group document.
        The idea was that we would then only have one version and everyone would know where the others were up to.
        Unfortunately, this did not work as planned. The document was difficult to format and work with in Microsoft
        Teams. It was easier to use our own version of Word. So, we started downloading our own version with the
        intention of copying back the final version. The end result was many different versions of files and versions
        being proof read that were not truly the final version. It did not exactly go to plan.
        We also found there were a lot of files saved into our main chat in Teams. Lots of versions. It became a little
        confusing to know what was the latest.
        </p>

      <p>
        We also were not able to delete old files for some reason. So possibly the reliance on sharing files in the chat repository was not the ideal way for us.

      <h2 id="career">Career Plans</h2>

      <p>
      <h3>Compare and Contrast the career plans, including ideal jobs, for each person</h3>
      <p>
        Christopher’s Ideal Job – Software Developer <br>
        Nicole’s Ideal Job - Financial Crime Intelligence Analyst <br>
        Liljana's Ideal Job - Biomedical Software Engineer <br>
        Matthew's Ideal Job – Cyber Security Analyst <br>
        Gerard's Ideal Job – Software Developer – Medical Computing <br>
      </p>

      <h3> What common elements are there, if any?</h3>

      <ul>
        <li>Only 2 out of the 5 ideal jobs fell into the same category for industry, which was Medical.</li>
        <li>The most common Generic Skill required across the Ideal Jobs is: Problem Solving, Team Work/Collaboration,
          Communication & Writing.
        </li>
        <li>The most common IT Specific skill across the Ideal Jobs is: C++, Git & Software Developer/Engineer</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>What differentiates each position from the others, if anything?</h3>

      <p>Most of the ideal job positions are related to Software development/Engineering. Even the Cyber Security
        Analyst requires some level of development.
        The only role does not involve Software development is the Financial Crime Intelligence – this is more of a data
        analysis type role. Looking at data as opposed to creating software.
        As mentioned above, most of the roles involve problem solving, communication and team work. All of these skills
        would be a massive advantage in any workplace as it would be rare to have
        a job that involves total isolation. Teams that work together well have the ability to create and deliver
        amazing projects.</p>

      <h3>How similar or different are your career plans across the group?</h3>

      <p>The majority of our group have been drawn to Software development. Although each may have selected a unique
        area they are all still focused on the development side.
        Two group members have also chosen the medical side of development.
        Two group members have chosen more analytic type roles – Crime Intelligence and Cyber Security.</p>

      <h3>Has the ideal job changed due to feedback from Assignment 1 or 2? </h3>

      <h4>Christopher </h4>

      <h4> Nicole</h4>
      <p>My ideal job has not changed since I have received more feedback. I still think my ideal job would be a
        Financial Crime Intelligence Analyst.</p>

      <h4>Liljana </h4>
      <p>My ideal job being a Bio Medical Software Engineer has not changed. I would still love to work in bio medics and help humans live a better life. I really enjoyed learning about AI, ML and robotics. So, this has confirmed to me of my interest in biomedicine and how technology can help improve human livelihoods. </p>
